# [Pod Sorter for LinkedIn](http://linkedin-pod-sorter.herokuapp.com)

The LinkedIn Pod is a powerful tool to increase your reach on LinkedIn and get in front of new audiences. The client's posts now have a range of 2000-15000 views every time he uses it, and as a result he's added 1-2 high paying clients every month simply through visibility.

It’s based on making the most of the LinkedIn algorithm, which tends to show a post to more people (in and outside of your network) if at least 14-15 people have commented on it within 2 hrs of being posted.

The ideal situation is having 10-15 people who will reliably comment on each other's posts at least once per week. It’s ultimately not a lot of time but still requires consistency, increasing your visibility is a habit, not a one-off.
